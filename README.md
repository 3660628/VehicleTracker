VehicleTracker
==============

This application allows the tracking of the device in which it is installed in. Typically, the application would be installed in an Android smartphone with GPS enabled. This phone would then be wired into an ignition live or a continuous live of a vehicle which would enable the device to be always on. The application would be able to receive commands via sms. This is a work in progress, but the ultimate aim is to allow the device to send its position information and speed etc to any other device or web service via sms/email/twitter - depending on the choice made by the user. The application can be also used as a personal tracking app so that friends and family can see where you are at all times or when you want them.
